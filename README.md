matRad Python Conversion



This repository is a Python-based conversion of the original matRad project, a radiation therapy treatment planning system. The project is currently under development, and several features are being actively implemented and tested.

About matRad

matRad is an open-source radiation therapy treatment planning toolkit. The original version was developed in MATLAB and has been widely used for educational and research purposes. This Python-based project aims to translate the core functionality of matRad into Python to provide:

Improved accessibility for users who do not have access to MATLAB.

Easier integration with modern Python libraries and tools.

Enhanced modularity and extensibility.

Current Status

ðŸš§ Under Development ðŸš§

This Python version of matRad is a work-in-progress, and its functionality may not yet match the original MATLAB implementation. Expect changes in APIs, features, and documentation as development progresses.

Stay tuned for more updates as the project evolves.

Features (Planned)

Fully open-source and Python-native implementation.

Support for photon, proton, and carbon ion therapy.

Integration with Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and PyTorch for enhanced computational capabilities.

DICOM import/export for seamless clinical data handling.

Easy-to-use APIs for researchers and clinicians.

Installation

Since the project is under development, installation from source is recommended:

git clone https://github.com/MohammadrezaMC2/matRad_python.git
cd matRad_python
pip install -r requirements.txt

Requirements will be updated as the project matures.

Usage

Basic usage examples and documentation will be added soon. For now, refer to the source code and ongoing commits for insights into the development process.
